# IN Operator

## OData Specification

The IN operator is a [new feature](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/new-in-odata/v4.01/cn01/new-in-odata-v4.01-cn01.html#_Toc485385090 "new feature") in OData 4.01 that enables a shorthand way of writing multiple EQ expressions joined by OR. For example,

`GET /service/Products?$filter=Name eq 'Milk' or Name eq 'Cheese' or Name eq 'Donut'`

can become

`GET /service/Products?$filter=Name in ('Milk', 'Cheese', 'Donut')`

Of the binary expression invoking IN, the left operand must be a single value and the right operand must be a comma-separated list of primitive values or a single expression that resolves to a collection; the expression returns true if the left operand is a member of the right operand.

## Syntax

### [Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/csprd04/abnf/ "Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)")

Per the ABNF, the IN operator is part of the common expression syntax

```
commonExpr = ( primitiveLiteral
             / arrayOrObject
             / rootExpr
             / firstMemberExpr
             / functionExpr
             / negateExpr
             / methodCallExpr
             / parenExpr
             / listExpr
             / castExpr
             / isofExpr
             / notExpr
             )
             [ addExpr
             / subExpr
             / mulExpr
             / divExpr
             / divbyExpr
             / modExpr
             ]
             [ eqExpr
             / neExpr
             / ltExpr
             / leExpr
             / gtExpr
             / geExpr
             / hasExpr
             / inExpr
```

Test cases explicitly outlined by the ABNF spec include the following (see Scenarios for details on some of these types of queries):

```xml
<TestCase Name="5.1.1.1.12 Logical Operator Examples" Rule="boolCommonExpr">
  <Input>Name in ('Milk', 'Cheese')</Input>
</TestCase>
<TestCase Name="5.1.1.1.12 Logical Operator Examples" Rule="boolCommonExpr">
  <Input>Name in ["Milk", "Cheese"]</Input>
</TestCase>
```

## Design Strategy

### Uri Query Expression Parser

The logic to parse expressions for query options are written in the UriQueryExpressionParser class (`src\Microsoft.OData.Core\UriParser\Parsers\UriQueryExpressionParser.cs`). The algorithm tokenizes the expression by whitespaces and builds QueryTokens from the operands. If more than one operand exists, then the algorithm recursively builds the right operand as a tree.

There exists a code flow for generating binary operator tokens (used for eq, ne, gt, ge, has, etc.), which would make sense for IN to follow. However, the binary operator tokens are eventually converted to binary operator nodes, where the left and right nodes must be single value nodes; the binary operator node does not suit the IN operator, which has a left single-valued operand and right collection-valued operand. Therefore, we will create separate QueryToken, MetadataBinder, and SingleValueNode classes to accommodate IN but maintain a similar code flow as the binary operator.

Additionally, we will need to ensure that the expression parser can read static collections (i.e. parentheses-enclosed members), so we will derive from the CollectionNode class to represent the static collection.

#### QueryToken Class

We will need to derive a separate class for IN scenarios. The code path looks similar to the BinaryOperatorToken construction but the algorithm will result in an InToken, which holds different information from the BinaryOperatorToken. See `src\Microsoft.OData.Core\UriParser\Parsers\UriQueryExpressionParser.cs : ParseComparison()` for code path.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Base class for all lexical tokens of OData query.
/// </summary>
public abstract class QueryToken 
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Empty list of arguments.
    /// </summary>
    public static readonly QueryToken[] EmptyTokens = new QueryToken[0];

    /// <summary>
    /// The kind of the query token.
    /// </summary>
    public abstract QueryTokenKind Kind { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Accept a <see cref="ISyntacticTreeVisitor{T}"/> to walk a tree of <see cref="QueryToken"/>s.
    /// </summary>
    /// <typeparam name="T">Type that the visitor will return after visiting this token.</typeparam>
    /// <param name="visitor">An implementation of the visitor interface.</param>
    /// <returns>An object whose type is determined by the type parameter of the visitor.</returns>
    public abstract T Accept<T>(ISyntacticTreeVisitor<T> visitor);
}
```

#### SingleValueNode Class

The InNode will derive from the SingleValueNode class and will have similarities with the BinaryOperatorNode. The InNode will have a SingleValueNode and CollectionNode.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Base class for all semantic metadata bound nodes which represent a single composable value.
/// </summary>
public abstract class SingleValueNode : QueryNode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the type of the single value this node represents.
    /// </summary>
    public abstract IEdmTypeReference TypeReference
    {
        get;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the kind of this node.
    /// </summary>
    public override QueryNodeKind Kind
    {
        get { return (QueryNodeKind)this.InternalKind; }
    }
}
```

#### Static Collections with Parentheses/Brackets

The expression parser must also recognize static collections enclosed by parentheses or brackets. In these instances, the parser must create a collection with such objects. Therefore we will create a new CollectionConstantNode, derived from CollectionNode, that represents a list of ConstantNodes.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Base class for all semantic metadata bound nodes which represent a composable collection of values.
/// </summary>
public abstract class CollectionNode : QueryNode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The resouce type of a single item from the collection represented by this node.
    /// </summary>
    public abstract IEdmTypeReference ItemType
    {
        get;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// The type of the collection represented by this node.
    /// </summary>
    public abstract IEdmCollectionTypeReference CollectionType
    {
        get;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the kind of this node.
    /// </summary>
    public override QueryNodeKind Kind
    {
        get { return (QueryNodeKind)this.InternalKind; }
    }
}
```
